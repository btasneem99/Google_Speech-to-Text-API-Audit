    "I recorded the speech myself. I read paragraphs from 10 New York Times article. The recordings are between 53 s and 59 s. The articles were in the following categories: politics (4 articles); weather (2 articles); health (2 articles); and art and culture (2 articles). I picked articles from different categories so that there would be a wider variety of words in the input data. Another thing to note about the speech being input is that I am an international student and do not have a standard American accent. I used the Google Speech-to-Text API. Certain articles that I read contained transliteration of foreign words and names that I read aloud. My hypothesis is that the API will underperform for these articles/recordings (e.g. Recording_2 and Recording_6). Additionally, the API will struggle with understanding accented speech so it is unlikely we will get a high (90% +) word match. I did not use an uniform speed to record all these articles. The speed varied a lot between articles. For example, I read the article quite fast for Recording_9. My hypothesis is that the API will not struggle with faster speech."

    "recording_1_text = 'Is There Something Radical About Painting Flowers?Many artists who made their names in figurative work are now creating a different sort of portrait. In Early 2021, Jordan Casteel, the painter known for her tender, exquisitely detailed oil portraits of Black men and other people of color in and around her Harlem community, made two unexpected moves. First, she relocated from New York City to a rural part of the Catskills, a far less populous place where she barely knew anyone. The second move, this one artistic but no less momentous, was that Casteel, 35, began began painting pictures of flowers. The first floral painting she made after arriving upstate was born of a moment of disorientation: Casteel was trying to determine how her practice would work, “being so far from people, and so far from a familiar landscape,” she says. While mulling over this predicament, she was spending hours tending her garden'\n",

But they are not boogeymen; they are real people and, according to Patric Gagne, widely misunderstood. Gagne wrote “Sociopath,” her buzzy forthcoming memoir, to try to correct some of those misunderstandings and provide a fuller picture of sociopathy, which is now more frequently referred to as antisocial personality disorder. As a child, Gagne found herself compelled toward violent outbursts in an effort to try to compensate for the emotional apathy that was her default. As she got older, those compulsive behaviors turned into criminal ones like trespassing and theft. Eventually, she discovered that there was a name — that dreaded word — that could be used to describe and explain her'\n",

A state judge in Illinois ruled on Wednesday that former President Donald J. Trump had engaged in insurrection and was ineligible to appear on the state’s primary ballot. The decision creates uncertainty for the state’s March election, in which early voting is already underway. It also adds urgency for the U.S. Supreme Court to provide a national answer to the questions that have been raised about Mr. Trump’s eligibility to appear on ballots in more than 30 states.The judge, Tracie R. Porter of the State Circuit Court in Cook County, said the State Board of Elections had erred in rejecting an attempt to remove Mr. Trump and said the board shall remove Donald J.

The economy is now in recession after barely growing for decades. The population continues to shrink, with births last year plunging to a nadir. The country’s politics appear frozen as one party holds a virtual lock on power no matter how scandal-tainted and unpopular it becomes.But not to worry. This is Japan, where all bad news is relative.Take a look around. There are few signs of the societal discord you might expect in a place with trend lines like Japan’s, such as accumulating garbage, potholes or picket lines. The country remains remarkably stable and cohesive, with little sense of impending doom. That equanimity reflects a no-need-to-rock-the-boat mind-set: Shouganai — it can’t be helped — is something of a national refrain.'\n",

The pair criticized President Biden’s handling of the border crisis. Kari Lake, the former television anchor running for U.S. Senate in Arizona, spent Thursday afternoon charming supporters at a Scottsdale ballpark during a spring training game. Then she shifted tone, excoriating President Biden’s handling of the migrant crisis, which she called an “invasion,” at a news conference with Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming. “I don’t know why we have laws in Joe Biden’s world. None of the ones that protect us as American citizens are being enforced,” said Ms. Lake, rattling off a list of undocumented immigrants who had committed violent crimes in the United States. The dual appearances captured the range of Ms. Lake, whose blend of charisma and fiery rhetoric vaulted her to prominence in Arizona politics. But Ms. Lake’s divisive language in her 2022 campaign for governor pitted Republicans against one another, allowing her Democratic opponent to secure victory, and she could face similarly tough opposition this November. This time, she could have more help from the Republican establishment. The presence of Mr. Barrasso, the party’s No. 3-ranking leader, was the latest sign of the party’s embrace of a candidate whose extreme views made her a lightning rod just two years earlier. “I think our country would be much better and much safer if we had Kari Lake as a member of the United States Senate,” Mr. Barrasso said at the news conference.

    "# Observations about the API performance on your data\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to use word error rate as my metric for judging the performance of the Google API because my research showed that word error rate is less sensitive to word order and timing variations compared to other metrics like raw accuracy. It allows for some flexibility in word ordering, making it more suitable for assessing the performance of speech recognition systems. The above code that I wrote to calculate the word error rate defines a function calculate_wer which takes in two input strings ‘reference’ and ‘hypothesis’, which then calculates the word error rte using the Levenshtein distance. As previously stated in part a), I recorded the speech from 10 different New York Times articles of various categories to have a wide range of vocabulary represented in the input speech data. From looking at the API generated text and the word error rate, one observation is that the API is not that good with hearing intonation in voice and capitalizing certain words. For example, names such as Trump was capitalized. However, several (in fact, most) words in the titles of the articles that I read aloud were not capitalized. The word error rate is quite high. It ranges from 20.13 to 81.2. However, overall 6 out of the ten recordings achieves a word error rate which is in the 20-30 range. The API performs pretty well with names, much to my surprise. My previous guess was Recording_2 and Recording_5 would be the worst performing given the presence of many names. However, Recording_2 has a relatively low word error rate at 28.78. Recording_5 has a word error rate of 37.33. Recording_5 is not one of the worst performing recordings in the dataset. The worst performing recording in the dataset is Recording_9. One reason that I can think of for this poor performance of the API is that my reading speed for this article was much faster than my reading speed for the other ones. Perhaps, a faster reading speed coupled with my accent made my speech harder to understand for the API. This disproves my hypothesis that the API would not struggle with faster speech. A few other points to note is that, the Levenshtein distance does take the difference of capitalization (the difference between ‘Hello’ and ‘hello’) into account[6]. I chose not to make all of my ground-truth data lower-case because the API does capitalize some words based on intonation and I wanted to see which words the API would capitalize. If we choose to ignore the metric and just take a glance at the generated text ignoring punctuations, capitalizations etc, the API performance can be considered \"good\" since most words are accurately captured. However, depending on the scenario in which the API is being used, for-example, in the scenario where a visually impaired person is trying to write an essay using this API, the API not being able to detech punctuations and capitalizations would cause issues.
